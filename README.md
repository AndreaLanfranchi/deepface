# deepface

This is a derivative work from original project [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) by @serengil.
I love his initial idea and thank the author, but I consider the code base worth a lot of cleaning and performance
enhancements. At this moment my changed code is diverging too much from original so I decided to remove informations
which pertain to @serengil alone and his studies and researches.

This fork is all about performance, cleanness and expresiveness of the code while also removing some anti-patterns.

New informations will be published about improvements achieved.
